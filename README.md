ðŸ§  .NET MAUI Learning & Practice Projects
This repository contains my personal .NET MAUI learning exercises, written while following various courses and tutorials.

Each project reflects what Iâ€™ve learned and practiced â€” from UI layout and MVVM patterns to exploring .NET MAUI fundamentals, architecture, and platformâ€‘specific features.

The code here is purely educational and serves as a reference for:

Experimenting with MAUI controls, navigation, data binding, and layout systems
Practicing patterns like MVVM, Dependency Injection, and Clean Architecture basics
Testing APIs, local databases (SQLite), and crossâ€‘platform features
Deepening understanding of C#, XAML, and MAUIâ€™s project structure
ðŸ’¡ This repository represents my learning journey â€” code written while following courses and tutorials, experimenting with ideas before applying them to realâ€‘world projects.
